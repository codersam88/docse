 \subsection{System Overview}
 The Bin-packing VM consolidation algorithm has following modules.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Parser Module: Takes file name as input from user for parsing that file and calls addPM function in PMmodifier module 
  to pass the values that have been read.
  \item User Interface Module: User interface is useful for taking input from  user and giving results to the user. First this module asks user to load an 
input file and passes it to parser module. After initialization of the PMs and VMs by the PM modifier module it displays a 
screen with buttons specifying the PMs and labels specifying their respective VMs.\\
It also has buttons to specify functionalities of the the system such as addVM,deleteVM and consolidate.
\item PM Modifier Module: This module is responsible for creating physical machines(PM), adding virtual machines(VM) and doing 
modifications to them. This is also responsible for consolidation operation.
 \end{enumerate}
